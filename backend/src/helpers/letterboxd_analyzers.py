                        Each new review starts with ">>>".

                        Please analyze these reviews and identify the top 5 most mentioned cinematic aspects of the movie. 
                        For each aspect, provide the following:

                        1. The percentage of reviews that mention the aspect positively (as an integer).
                        2. The percentage of reviews that mention the aspect negatively (as an integer).

                        Please return the results as a Python dictionary string that can be directly evaluated using `ast.literal_eval()`. 
                        The dictionary should have:
                        - The cinematic aspect names (e.g., "Acting", "Direction", "Dialogue", "Color Scheme" etc.) as keys (strings).
                        - The values should be lists containing *exactly two integers*:
                            - The first integer represents the percentage of reviews mentioning the aspect positively.
                            - The second integer represents the percentage of reviews mentioning the aspect negatively.

                        While calculating the percentages, take into account ALL the reviews, not just the ones that mention that aspect.

                        Example output format:
                            {{
                                "Dialogue": [30, 10],
                                "Direction": [20, 15],
                                "Cinematography": [2, 10],
                                "Music": [5, 8],
                                "Plot": [3, 3],
                                "Actor Name": [2, 1],
                                "Director Name": [1, 2]
                            }}
                        Do not output the exact same dictionary as the
                        example output please. Aspects can include, but
                        are not limited to: acting, direction, cinematography,
                        sound/music, themes, pacing, performances, visuals, plot,
                        character development, etc. Do not shy away from
                        emphasising on negative aspects if that is the case.
                        The sum of positive and the negative review percentage will
                        likely be much less than 100, which is expected and okay.
