                      trashed or the embarrassing five-star they handed out. Drag their

                      trapped in an endless Marvel marathon? Make fun of their binge

                      single film, expose them. Roast their review style—whether they write
                      pretentious essays, cryptic one-word takes, or full-on Wikipedia summaries.
